ArkBreedingXmlStatCombiner: Used to combine the XML's from multiple people from the Ark Smart Breeding Tool

We play Ark Survival Evolved (https://survivetheark.com/) with a group of people.
We all breed dinosaurs.
We all used the Ark Smart Breeding tool (https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor/).
We all want to combine our XML's, to stay up to date.
We all can, now, with this. Or something! :D
